          by boat.
          <br />
          The island shelters a multitude of lemurs protected by the “fady”
          (litteraly a prohibition). They are indeed considered sacred by the
          island’s inhabitants. Therefore they are not hunted nor disturbed in
          any way. Among the many species you will see the Macaco Lemur, who

        <h1>LOKOBE PARK NATIONAL</h1>
        <img src="lokobe-nature-special.jpg" alt="/" />
        <p>
          Parc National Lokobe protects most of Nosy Be’s remaining endemic
          vegetation. The reserve is home to the black lemur (the male is dark
          brown, almost black, while the female is a lovely chestnut colour with
          white tufts around her ears and cheeks) and several other lemur
          species. You’re also likely to spot boa constrictors, owls, chameleons
          and many wonderful plants, from ylang-ylang trees to vanilla orchids,
          travellers' palms and more. The best time to visit is November to
          January.
          <br />
          You will need a guide to visit Parc National Lokobe and one of the
          best is Jean Robert. Jean organises excellent day trips that cost
          Ar110,000 per person from Hell-Ville or Ar150,000 from Andilana. This
          includes a taxi between your hotel and Ambatozavavy, transfer in
          pirogue (dugout canoe) from Ambatozavavy to Ampasipohy (the starting
          point for walks), a two-hour walk in the forest, lunch, drinks and
          admission fees to the park.
          <br />
          As well as knowing the area intimately and being a mine of information
          on all things fauna and flora, Jean is a real character, who will have
          you singing a Malagasy version of 'Old McDonald's Farm' before you set
          off but then insist on silence during the visit to minimise disruption
          to Lokobe’s wildlife (he’ll just whisper the names of the animals as
          you go).
          <br />
          You'll need shorts and slip-slops (thongs) on the boat but long pants
          and closed shoes for walking in the forest. Sun cream, a hat and
          insect repellent are essential, too.
